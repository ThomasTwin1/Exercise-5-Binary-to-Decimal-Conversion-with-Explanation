#TODO:Binary to Decimal Conversion with Explanation
# Choose a binary number string, such as "1101".
# Write out the powers of 2 for each position manually, as shown in the example above.
# Calculate the decimal value on paper or by hand.
# Verify your calculation using the int() function in Python.

# Choose a binary number string, such as "1101".
binary_number = "1101"

# Write out the powers of 2 for each position manually, as shown in the example above.
# - Starting from the right:
#      - 1 (rightmost) → \(2^0\) = 1
#      - 1 → \(2^1\) = 2
#      - 0 → \(2^2\) = 0
#      - 1 (leftmost) → \(2^3\) = 8

result = int(binary_number, 2)

# Verify your calculation using the int() function in Python.
print(result)
